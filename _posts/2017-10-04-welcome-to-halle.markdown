Welcome to Halle (Saale).

This first day of checking into the institute. It is big and bureaucratic. Lots of things are built on people talking to each-other - inefficient.  

In any case, here are some important information about steps of what to do: 

## Up on arrival: how to become German (together with your spouse)

1.  Get a housing contract. Thankfully the institute helps with that.

1.  Get an appointment to register at the City Hall [here](https://www.halle.de/de/Verwaltung/Online-Angebote/Online-Dienste/Terminvereinbarung/Termin-Buergerservic-08648/). You may need to wait for 2 weeks before you get your appointment. 

1.  Get an insurance done (photos submitted). I had a TK Insurance before I came here...

1.  Get a bank account (N-26 is working very efficiently and you can get an account in 30 min) https://next.n26.com/en-de/bank-account

1.  Get an appointment for the id card application [here](https://www.halle.de/de/Verwaltung/Online-Angebote/Online-Dienste/Terminvereinbarung/Termin-Auslaenderbeh-08653/) or better ask your HR officer to make it for you because of the very long lines.

1.  Make sure you know how the university is functioning and what re the registration procedures for a doctorate student. For more information see follow up post. 

## New Internet Sim-card

The choice is crazily limited in Germany... 

Practically, that is all i managed to find so far.

1. 15 EUR / 3 GB https://www.simplytel.de/tarifuebersicht#allnet_flats_lte_tab
