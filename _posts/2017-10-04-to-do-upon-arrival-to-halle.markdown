Welcome to Halle (Saale).

First days of checking into the institute are bureaucratic. There are lots of inefficient things built on people talking to each-other. Do not give up. Here are some important steps, which we need to take in order to become legal here:

# To do up on arrival (together with your spouse - optional)

1. Drink some wine before reading this.  

1. Get a housing contract. Ms. Kunart at the guest house is very helpful. The institute helps with that.  

1. Get your working contract / scholarship letter / invitation letter (if you do not have any).  

   - If you have a short term contract for 6 month (you had this temporary fix from the IAMO), but you know that you will stay for more than that, ask the follow-up contract for the entire period and carry it together with your short term contract.  
   
1. Get an appointment to register at the City Hall [here](https://www.halle.de/de/Verwaltung/Online-Angebote/Online-Dienste/Terminvereinbarung/Termin-Buergerservic-08648/):  

   - You may need to wait for 2 or more weeks before you get your appointment.  
   - You need to make the following appointment: ![BÃ¼rgerservice > Anmeldung](https://github.com/EBukin/EBukin.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/cityhall-appointment.png")  
   
1. Get an insurance:  

   - [TK insurance](https://www.tk.de/) if you are an employee of IAMO. Ms Anett.Bleyer (Anett.Bleyer@tk.de) works with IAMO at the TK in Halle. Ms Blankenburg (blankenburg@iamo.de) helps with the TK insurance at IAMO.
   - Sometimes, you need the insurance before you apply for visa. For that reason, you can try to get your TK insurance even before coming to IAMO. This was my case. Icontacted to Ms. Bleyer, who contacted to Ms. Blankenburg and I obtained TK insurance confirmation before I have applied for the visa.
   
2. Get a German mobile phone number if you do not have any or you do not have another EU phone number. The choice is crazily limited in Germany...
   - 15 EUR / 3 GB [](https://www.simplytel.de/tarifuebersicht#allnet_flats_lte_tab) or 20 EUR / 3 GB [](https://www.base.de/tarife). This is shocking if you compare it with other EU countries.
2. Get a bank account (may require german or EU phone number)
   - Choose yourself the best bank you want. I recommend [N-26](https://next.n26.com/). It took me 30 minutes to get a bank account done via Internet and to obtain IBAN. No need to show residency contract, sufficient to have an EU phone number and a (iOs/Android) phone with the Front/Rare cameras and flashlight. Need to have a valid address. **The bank is fully English speaking** and has the best banking mobile app I have ever used.
2. Get an appointment in the immigration office for the German id card application [here](https://www.halle.de/de/Verwaltung/Online-Angebote/Online-Dienste/Terminvereinbarung/Termin-Auslaenderbeh-08653/) :
   - Normally, there are very long lines you need to wait in order to get an appointment (3-4 month), therefore, ask Ms. Petra Zehler (Zehler@iamo.de) - your HR officer to help you with that.
   - See [here](http://www.bamf.de/EN/Willkommen/Aufenthalt/WichtigeInformationen/wichtigeinformationen-node.html) some extra information about the residency permit;
   - Keep in mind the benefits that you can get in the immigration office. If you get a residency for more than 6 month, you can get a certificate for language courses for you and for your accompanying spouses. **YOU NEED TO ASK FOR THIS**.
   - When you come to the immigration office for your appointment, you get a paper that proves that you will have an ID for a fixed period. Using this proof together with the language certification, you can enroll for the integration/language courses.
   - **Fore more information on the process, see the relevant web-page on this website**.
2. Get enrolled for the integration-language courses using the certificate from the immigration office.
   - Only if you want to learn German, you can enroll in the language course. There is a wide selection of schools in Halle. You can ask a list of language schools at the immigration office. I personally preferred the intensive integration courses at Inlingua. I have 3 hours of language courses a day. It is intensive and effective.
   - You need the language certificate in order to enroll in the intensive language courses at the discounted price. Instead of 400 euros for 5 week (125 hours), you will be paying 200 euros.
   - Later, after you complete six levels of language courses (through the levels A1.1, A1.2, A2.1, A2.2, B1.1 and B1.2), you will have a chance to take and exam. If you do exam well, you have to ask to claim 50% of money spend on studying back! You need to look and ask for this benefit.
2. Become a member of the PhD network in Halle. Ask any of your colleagues to forward you an email from the PhD network and ask for a membership. It gives you access to many useful updates happening among PhD's;
2. Get a registration at the university in Halle as a PhD student:
   - Costs about 200 Euros per semester.
   - Gives you a student card.
   - Significant discount in Mensa.
   - Free public transportation in the region. [See the map](https://www.mdv.de/site/uploads/lnp_mdv_gesamt.pdf) of the public transport in the region.
   - **Fore more detail on the registration in the university, see the relevant post on this website**.
   - Hint. You can postpone the registration for as long as possible to avoid paying money.
2. Find a new apartment in Halle, because you need to move out of your house at some point:
   - **Be aware of people trying to fraud you! Never pay anything before you signed a contract even if the ask you to deposit money in order to see the apartment.**
2. Avoid becoming a heavy drinker.
