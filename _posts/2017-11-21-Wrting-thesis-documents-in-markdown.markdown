When I started my PhD in October 2017 (it was only 2 month) I was certain about one thing: I need to stop using Microsoft Word and Excel for my private needs and everyday work that do not include collaboration with and dependency on others. I also wanted to use git in order to track versions of my work. Therefore, I found a solution in developing my work in **Markdown**. Below, I document my journey through Markdown, R Markdown and LaTeX, what and how I use it.

# Getting started

I stated working with `.md` because of `R`. Once I had to document some results of my statistical analysis and I used R markdown for that. Ever since then, I was infected by the simplicity and (quasi-) robustness of markdown and wanted to use it for everyday work.

* [R for data science - R Markdown](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html)

Then, I slowly realized that using R for writing and documenting work all the time is not the best thing to do because it destructs allot. Therefore, I decided to to find a way of using pure markdown with more control over layout and direct usage of pandoc.
